    <p>Hello Everyone, I am Abhinav Acharya, I am a junior at Rutgers studying Math and Computer Science. Let me tell you briefly about myself. 
        I am a semi-professional musician and I have been playing tabla for the past 8 years and piano for the past 2 years.
        I am also a computer programmer and I participate in competitions and hackathons around Rutgers and the tristate area. 
        I am currently a member of Rutgers Dhol Effect, a band where I play tabla and perform at various events. 
        You can find more about Rutgers Dhol Effect on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rudholeffect/">Instagram page</a>.
