    <p><strong>Abhinav Acharya</strong></p>

    <p>Hello Everyone, I am Abhinav Acharya, I am a junior at Rutgers studying Math and Computer Science. Let me tell
        you briefly about myself.
        I am a semi-professional musician and I have been playing tabla for the past 8 years and piano for the past 2
        years. I have been playing tabla at various events and concerts around the tristate area. I also am a decent
        piano player, and I try to make my own music as well.
        I am also a computer programmer and I participate in competitions and hackathons around Rutgers and the tristate
        area, I want to try and combine music with computer science and create something new and innovative.
        I am currently a member of Rutgers Dhol Effect, a band where I play tabla and perform at various events.
        You can find more about Rutgers Dhol Effect on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rudholeffect/">Instagram
            page</a>. If you want we are also going to be performing at the Rutgers Day on April 27, 2024 make sure to check us out!.
