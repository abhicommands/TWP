    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog! Today, I want to embark on a different kind of project. It's easy to
        throw things away without a second thought, but what if we paused before tossing something in the trash? I'm
        starting an experiment where I'll be tracking the items I'd normally discard, and taking a moment to reflect on
        their role in my life.</p>
    <p>Why am I doing this? Honestly, I've become increasingly aware of my trash footprint. It's time to examine my
        habits and see if there are ways to reduce waste. Can I reuse something in a creative way? Is it recyclable?
        Sometimes, I might even realize an item still has value and deserves to stay in my possession!, In addition
        after reading many different passionate authors and thier views about trash I also have gotten more concious
        about my own decisions to help with trash footprint. If you want to read more about these authors and their
        contributions and how they inspired me feel free to check out my expanded preface where I go into detail their
        work and how it has inspired me.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="essay.html">Read More</a></p>
    <p>I hope you'll join me on this journey of mindful consumption. It might be surprising what we learn from the
        things we think we no longer need. If you're curious to read my reflections and detailed analysis of 'trash',

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>This week I am actually traveling to a musical instrument recycling/repair shop where I will be recycling
        them.
        Due to this, I decided that I was going to recycle all my instruments that are currently not producing the
        desired sound. I had a lot of emotional difficulty recycling my first-ever instrument. I connected to this
        instrument on a deeper level and had a lot of nostalgia and memories with it, so it was very difficult to
        let go
        of this instrument.</p>

    <h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>

    <h3>Instruments <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i></h3>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla">A Tabla</a> Old (playing percussion instrument) : </strong>
        <br>
        I got this in 8th grade when I started learning Tabla from a teacher outside of school, and ever since then I
        have put about 2000 hours into learning tabla and I am kind of a semi-professional musician right now for
        this
        specific instrument. And this has really helped me but currently this instrument really has no use as you
        see
        there is a tear in the instrument. I am currently recycling this instrument to a repair shop because it's
        not
        helpful for me as it doesn’t produce a desirable sound, however this is my first tabla and I will always be
        thankful.
    </p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano">A Piano</a> : </strong> <br>
        Recently 2 years ago I found out that I have a very very good relative pitch. It's not perfect pitch like
        Charlie
        Puth but I have relatively very good pitch recognition, hence I started self learning piano. However we had
        to
        recently move and whilst moving something must’ve happened to this digital piano and now it no longer works,
        and
        produces many noises and I have never gotten a chance to trash it but this week it so happened that I am
        going
        to a music recycling center where I can give these items for the person to fix it and recycle it instead of
        just
        throwing it away in the trash.
    </p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madal"> A Maadal</a> : </strong>
        <br> Again this instrument has also been with us for about 6 years and I have accompanied many of south asian
        folk
        singers that sing folk songs which this instrument is used for and I have used it so much that again the
        sound
        that this instrument produces isn’t desirable anymore and taking upon the opportunity to I am recycling all
        of
        these instruments which are much better if they are recycled and then the seller can resell them for other
        people to use and make proper use of these rather than it just staying at my house doing nothing hence I
        have
        decided to recycle this instrument as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Digital Items <i class="fa-solid fa-microchip"></i></h3>

    <p><strong>A Desktop : </strong> <br>I have had this desktop for the past 8 years and my dad has used it for his own
        usage however
        recently he has
        gotten a newer and nicer laptop and hasn’t touched this desktop so we decided to recycle this in the
        electronics
        disposable center.
    <p>

    <p><strong>A Laptop : </strong>
        <br>In 10th grade high school I bought a gaming laptop where I have played many video games and I have put
        quite
        a
        lot of hours playing <a href="https://www.minecraft.net">minecraft</a>, <a
            href="https://www.fortnite.com/">fortnite</a> and those games and currently after many many hours of usage
        and it
        also dropped while moving and currently the screen is cracked and doesn’t work anymore. I still never found
        a
        chance to recycle or trash this however doing this blog I realized and remembered that I have to recycle
        this
        laptop. I am still kind of sad to let this go as in this laptop I have made many memories playing games,
        doing
        projects and homeworks and everything so it's very sad to see it go away.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Some extra unused wires : </strong> <br>These are many wires that we accumulated as time passes
    throughout and I have been
    keeping all the extra
    unused
    wires that I am not going to need anymore however I never got a chance to recycle them as I had never had
    time
    to go to a recycle center for electronics however now that I have the chance today I will be recycling them
    today.</p>

    <h3>Cosmetic items</h3>

    <p><strong>A antiperspirant cream : </strong><br>
        I have a bit of <a
            href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/excessive-sweating#:~:text=What%20is%20hyperhidrosis%3F,order%20to%20avoid%20touching%20others.">hyperhidrosis</a>
        issue and it kind of affects my palm because I sweat it a lot hence I am using
        this
        cream to help me deal with this, however it was over about 3 months ago and has been collecting dust so I
        decided to trash this item.</p>

    <p><strong>A perfume : </strong><br>
        Similar to the antiperspirant cream, this has also been staying in my bathroom collecting dust as it was over
        already 3 weeks ago and I decided to trash them and document it today because I have a chance to do it.</p>

    <p><strong> A powder : </strong> <br>
        I recently bought this powder and I realized that it causes some rashes and I might be allergic to the
        contents
        of this powder hence I decided to trash it.</p>

    <h2 id="itemOfTheWeek">Item of the Week</h2>

    <p>I think the tabla is definitely the item of the week. I am a semi-professional tabla player, and I have spent
        more than 8 years playing and practicing this instrument so throwing away the first tabla that started it
        all
        was very sad and was a big step for me. I think that I have spent more than 400 hours at least on this tabla
        just practicing and around 8 hours or so performing these instruments in concerts. One fun moment was when I
        was
        performing on a stage one day and mid-performance this instrument just randomly goes out of tune making me
        change the pitch of it mid-performance and play and tune the instrument at the same time. It was a great and
        a
        really funny experience.</p>

    <h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>

    <p>This was a great reflection as I learned to value all these things even more. I would try to reduce the waste
        as
        much as possible because I can reflect that everything that you own has some sort of importance to you so
        throwing them away feels a bit emotional. In addition due to reflections from last week I was able to be
        more
        conscious and recycle a lot of my items. Another thing I noticed is that I started remembering trash that I
        need
        to get rid of just because of this project as well, hence this made me trash a lot of items that have been
        doing
        nothing but collecting dust at my house. Anyways this is the end of this week's blog thank you so much for
        your
        time. See you guys next week!</p>
