    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone, welcome to my blog, today I am going to write about the items that I will be trashing but before
        trashing these items I want to understand how these items have helped me in my life and how I have used them. So
        I decided to track these items and understand how they have helped me get through the week. I have decided to
        document because I want to reduce my trash footprint by reflecting on the item that I am trashing and seeing if
        there are ways I can reuse/recycle them or even keep them rather than trashing them.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>This week I am actually traveling to a musical instrument recycling/repair shop where I will be recycling them.
        Due to this, I decided that I was going to recycle all my instruments that are currently not producing the
        desired sound. I had a lot of emotional difficulty recycling my first-ever instrument. I connected to this
        instrument on a deeper level and had a lot of nostalgia and memories with it, so it was very difficult to let go
        of this instrument.</p>

    <h3>Instruments</h3>

    <h4>An Old Tabla (playing percussion instrument)</h4>
    <p>I got this in 8th grade when I started learning Tabla from a teacher outside of school, and ever since then I
        have put about 2000 hours into learning tabla and I am kind of a semi-professional musician right now for this
        specific instrument. And this has really helped me but currently this instrument really has no use as you see
        there is a tear in the instrument. I am currently recycling this instrument to a repair shop because it's not
        helpful for me as it doesn’t produce a desirable sound, however this is my first tabla and I will always be
        thankful.</p>

    <h4>A Piano</h4>
    <p>Recently 2 years ago I found out that I have a very very good relative pitch. It's not perfect pitch like Charlie
        Puth but I have relatively very good pitch recognition, hence I started self learning piano. However we had to
        recently move and whilst moving something must’ve happened to this digital piano and now it no longer works, and
        produces many noises and I have never gotten a chance to trash it but this week it so happened that I am going
        to a music recycling center where I can give these items for the person to fix it and recycle it instead of just
        throwing it away in the trash.</p>

    <h4>A Maadal (south asian percussive instrument)</h4>
    <p>Again this instrument has also been with us for about 6 years and I have accompanied many of south asian folk
        singers that sing folk songs which this instrument is used for and I have used it so much that again the sound
        that this instrument produces isn’t desirable anymore and taking upon the opportunity to I am recycling all of
        these instruments which are much better if they are recycled and then the seller can resell them for other
        people to use and make proper use of these rather than it just staying at my house doing nothing hence I have
        decided to recycle this instrument as well.</p>

    <h3>Digital Items</h3>

    <h4>A Desktop</h4>
    <p>I have had this desktop for the past 8 years and my dad has used it for his own usage however recently he has
        gotten a newer and nicer laptop and hasn’t touched this desktop so we decided to recycle this in the electronics
        disposable center.</p>

    <h4>A Laptop</h4>
    <p>In 10th grade high school I bought a gaming laptop where I have played many video games and I have put quite a
        lot of hours playing minecraft, fortnite and those games and currently after many many hours of usage and it
        also dropped while moving and currently the screen is cracked and doesn’t work anymore. I still never found a
        chance to recycle or trash this however doing this blog I realized and remembered that I have to recycle this
        laptop. I am still kind of sad to let this go as in this laptop I have made many memories playing games, doing
        projects and homeworks and everything so it's very sad to see it go away.</p>

    <h4>Some extra unused wires</h4>
    <p>These are many wires that we accumulated as time passes throughout and I have been keeping all the extra unused
        wires that I am not going to need anymore however I never got a chance to recycle them as I had never had time
        to go to a recycle center for electronics however now that I have the chance today I will be recycling them
        today.</p>

    <h3>Cosmetic items</h3>

    <h4>A antiperspirant cream</h4>
    <p>I have a bit of hyperhidrosis issue and it kind of affects my palm because I sweat it a lot hence I am using this
        cream to help me deal with this, however it was over about 3 months ago and has been collecting dust so I
        decided to trash this item.</p>

    <h4>A perfume</h4>
    <p>Similar to the antiperspirant cream, this has also been staying in my bathroom collecting dust as it was over
        already 3 weeks ago and I decided to trash them and document it today because I have a chance to do it.</p>

    <h4>A powder</h4>
    <p>I recently bought this powder and I realized that it causes some rashes and I might be allergic to the contents
        of this powder hence I decided to trash it.</p>

    <h2 id="itemOfTheWeek">Item of the Week</h2>

    <p>I think the tabla is definitely the item of the week. I am a semi-professional tabla player, and I have spent
        more than 8 years playing and practicing this instrument so throwing away the first tabla that started it all
        was very sad and was a big step for me. I think that I have spent more than 400 hours at least on this tabla
        just practicing and around 8 hours or so performing these instruments in concerts. One fun moment was when I was
        performing on a stage one day and mid-performance this instrument just randomly goes out of tune making me
        change the pitch of it mid-performance and play and tune the instrument at the same time. It was a great and a
        really funny experience.</p>

    <h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>

    <p>This was a great reflection as I learned to value all these things even more. I would try to reduce the waste as
        much as possible because I can reflect that everything that you own has some sort of importance to you so
        throwing them away feels a bit emotional. In addition due to reflections from last week I was able to be more
        conscious and recycle a lot of my items. Another thing I noticed is that I started remembering trash that I need
        to get rid of just because of this project as well, hence this made me trash a lot of items that have been doing
        nothing but collecting dust at my house. Anyways this is the end of this week's blog thank you so much for your
        time. See you guys next week!</p>
